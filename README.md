Purpose
Reading Data: Load the dataset into a DataFrame for manipulation.
Cleaning Data: Perform necessary data cleaning operations.
Writing Data: Save the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file to ensure the cleaned data is available for future use.
Code Explanation
Import Libraries: Import the pandas library for data manipulation.
Load Dataset: Read the original dataset from a CSV file.
Initial Data Exploration: Display initial rows and check for missing values.
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values.
Convert categorical data to numerical values.
